On 19 April 2020, the Government of India annouced the third phase of vaccination programme would begin on 1 May, and for first time, all residents above the age of 18 would be eligible. However, even after six weeks of third phase's inception, it had been quite hard to find a vaccination slot. This has also been widely reported in media, for example, such as [this article on The Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/fastest-fingers-first-not-enough-to-get-vax-slot-those-in-18-44-age-group-find-it-difficult-to-get-vaccination-appointments-on-co-win/articleshow/82508435.cms) and [this article on the Print](https://theprint.in/health/struggling-to-find-an-open-covid-vaccination-slot-on-cowin-get-help-from-these-websites-apps/654013/).

The notebook contains a small script that would check for availability of vaccine through the [public API of CoWIN](https://apisetu.gov.in/api/cowin) every five to ten seconds on a designated day and for designated centers, and using [fast2sms](https://www.fast2sms.com/) API, it would send a text message to given mobile numbers. The script was originally intended to scale up for people to register requests for their respective or vaccination centers nearby, in form of a web application - this plan was not pursued as the vaccination availability became easier in a couple of weeks after this was developed.
